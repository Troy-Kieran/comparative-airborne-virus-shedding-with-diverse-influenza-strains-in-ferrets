## Overview
R code used to perform statistical analyses and create figures as part of this research study and manuscript on the comparative evaluation of airborne influenza virus shedding in ferrets. 

## Code Usage
AR_analysis.R script is self contained. Requires the relevent R packages installed, found in the script and in the section below. Input CSV data file if provided in the R_inputs directory along with a PNG file for import and use with figpatch. Whole script should only take a few minutes to run. However, output commands such as figure outputs using ragg has been commented out to make the output of figure files optional.

## Manuscript Abstract
Recent zoonotic outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) viruses in North America, particularly those linked to poultry and cattle, have underscored the urgent need to assess the pandemic potential of emerging strains. In this study, we investigated the pathogenesis, transmission dynamics, and airborne virus shedding of two B3.13 and two D1.1 genotype A(H5N1) viruses isolated from humans in 2024 using the ferret model. All four viruses caused severe, rapidly progressing systemic disease with high mortality following intranasal inoculation. One B3.13 genotype virus transmitted efficiently in the presence of direct contact, resulting in fatal outcomes in all exposed ferrets, whereas one D1.1 genotype virus showed limited transmission, with one of three contacts developing clinical signs of infection and another seroconverting to the challenge virus. None of the four strains tested transmitted via respiratory droplets. To better understand the relationship between viral replication and transmission potential, we conducted aerosol sampling using two air collection platforms (BC251 and SPOT) and expanded our virus panel to include additional A(H5N1), A(H9N2), A(H7N9), and A(H1N1)pdm09 strains with known differences in airborne transmissibility. Quantitative analysis of nasal wash and air samples revealed a strong correlation between viral loads in the respiratory tract and levels of airborne virus shedding, particularly for viruses known to transmit efficiently in ferrets. Although not airborne-transmissible in this study, B3.13 viruses exhibited significantly higher predicted airborne transmission potential than D1.1 viruses, based on greater amounts of infectious virus detected in the air, consistent with previously tested B3.13 strains that demonstrated limited airborne spread in the ferret model. These findings highlight the value of integrating quantitative measurements of virus shedding in the air with observed transmission outcomes to improve the resolution of pandemic risk assessments. This approach can help identify zoonotic influenza viruses that may be undergoing adaptation toward mammalian transmissibility, even in the absence of detectable airborne spread.
